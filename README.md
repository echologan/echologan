I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. We are what we repeatedly do. Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.

### What I'm Focused On:
- Learning: Currently diving deep into Java and building homelabs tinkering with network security.
- Projects: Working on a personal project that leverages APIs to create a user-friendly experience on web platforms.
